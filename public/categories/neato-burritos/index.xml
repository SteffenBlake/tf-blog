      <description>&lt;p&gt;TEST&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; an NFT is to the average individual, is primarily built on top of a lot of misconceptions, inaccuracies and over-simplifications. Every day I see people arguing back and forth over whether or not the ability to sell each other pictures is valuable or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The issue is this entire discussion is reductive. NFTs are a whole lot more than simply just pictures of monkeys. I would even go so far as to say that selling a piece of digital art with an NFT contract is the simplest most bare bone example and, though valid and it works, it also is extremely rudimentary and is only using a fraction of the potential of an NFT contract.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
