      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unity provides countless mechanisms by which one can shoot themself in the foot. It&amp;rsquo;s a common and popular entrypoint to picking up C# for newcomers to the language. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a common gotcha individuals will quickly begin to encounter as they familiarize themselves with the basics of the language via Unity&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;MonoBehavior&lt;/code&gt; classes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this comes with a common and harsh pitfall: by default, Unity really encourages individuals to produce countless individual batches of code that they tightly couple to their game objects, which results in sooner than usual confronting the big bad wolf that is the Byzantine Generals Problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
