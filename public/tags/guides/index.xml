      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building applications for IoT Devices has it’s challenges, and as I checked out several options presented by various libraries on various platforms, the consistent challenge I found was handling a variety of events across numerous board pins I wanted to listen on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every library I checked out involved a fair bit of boilerplate work I had to sort out in order to utilize multithreading on something like a Raspberry Pi’s multicore processor. What I really wanted was a way to easily describe subscriptions to pin events, spin up a listener, and then handle an incoming stream of events on the fly without blocking any threads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
